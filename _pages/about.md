About me
======
I am an Applied Scientist in the Causal Inference Group of AWS Research in Tuebingen. I did my PhD in the Empirical Inference department of Max PLanck Institute for Intelligent Systems under the supervision of [Prof. Bernhard Scholkopf](https://www.is.mpg.de/~bs) and [Dr. Dominik Janzing](https://www.is.mpg.de/~janzing), on the intersection of causality and neuroscience. Previously I received my Diploma from the school of [Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). My research interests include mainly causal inference and causal discovery methods for noisy, partially observed real world data.
